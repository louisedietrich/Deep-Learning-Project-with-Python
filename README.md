# Deep Learning Project with Python
## Non quality detection in images using deep learning  

The notebook display a use case of applying neural networks to classify types of defects on metallic surface images.
We used the [NEU surface dataset](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yunhyan/NEU_surface_defect_database.html) which contains 300 images of each of six metallic surface defects (a total of 1800 images). Each image is 200 × 200 pixels.

We built and trained a Convolution Neural Network, resulting in a 96.3% accuracy in predicting the right defect class for the images of our testing set.
